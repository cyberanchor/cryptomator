**cryptomotor** - cross-platform command-line tool for single file encryption and decryption, utilizing AES-256-GCM, HMAC-SHA512, and Argon2id for key derivation.
Optimized for large files (>4 GB), it supports streaming I/O, memory-mapped files, and detailed system block analysis, ensuring robust security and performance.

## Features
- **File Encryption/Decryption**: Encrypts files with AES-256-GCM and stores metadata in a 780-byte system block, with HMAC-SHA512 for integrity and authenticity.
- **Key Derivation**: Uses Argon2id with configurable memory (4 GB default, 64 MB low-memory mode), 8 iterations, and 8 parallel threads.
- **Large File Support**: Optimized for files >4 GB with streaming I/O and optional memory-mapped file access (--mmap).
- **System Block Analysis**: Provides detailed inspection of encrypted file metadata, including signature, salt, nonce, and HMAC.
- **Flexible Password Input**: Supports passwords via command-line, file, or interactive prompt (UTF-8, up to 4096 characters recommended).
- **Unicode Support**: Handles filenames up to 255 bytes in UTF-8 encoding.
- **Logging**: Detailed, colorized console output.
- **Security**: Validates inputs, enforces minimum file size (4 bytes), and ensures compatibility checks for older file formats.

## Cryptographic Architecture
- **Key Derivation**: Derives a 256-bit AES key using Argon2id with a 64-byte random salt, 4 GB memory (or 64 MB in low-memory mode), 8 iterations, and 8 parallel threads.
- **Encryption**: Encrypts file payload, filename, and SHA-512 hash with AES-256-GCM, using a 16-byte random nonce.
- **Integrity and Authenticity**: Computes HMAC-SHA512 over the payload, padded filename, and hash, stored in the system block.
- **System Block (780 bytes)**:
  - Signature: 8 bytes (`CRYPTv2`, hex: `43525950547632`).
  - Salt: 64 bytes (random, for Argon2id).
  - Nonce: 16 bytes (random, for AES-256-GCM).
  - HMAC: 64 bytes (SHA512, signs payload + padded filename + hash).
  - Encrypted Filename Length: 4 bytes (big-endian, always 496).
  - Encrypted Filename: 512 bytes (496-byte padded filename + 16-byte GCM tag).
  - Encrypted Hash: 80 bytes (64-byte SHA-512 hash + 16-byte GCM tag).
  - Original Filename Length: 4 bytes (big-endian, up to 255).
- **File Format**: `[system_block][encrypted_payload]`.
- **Hashing**: Computes SHA-512 hash of input files for verification during decryption.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cyberanchor/cryptomator
   cd cryptomator
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install cryptography argon2-cffi colorama psutil
   ```
3. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   python crypt.argon2.py --help
   ```

## Usage
### Command-Line Arguments
- `--encrypt`: Encrypt files in the specified folder or a single file.
- `--decrypt`: Decrypt files in the specified folder or a single file.
- `--analyze`: Analyze the system block of an encrypted file.
- `--folder <path>`: Folder to process (required for `--encrypt` or `--decrypt`).
- `--file <path>`: Single file to process or analyze.
- `--password <pass>`: Password for encryption/decryption.
- `--password-file <file>`: File containing the password (UTF-8).
- `--debug`: Enable detailed debug output for system block information.
- `--verbose`: Enable verbose console output.
- `--low-memory`: Use lower memory settings for Argon2id (64 MB instead of 4 GB).
- `--dry-run`: Simulate operations without writing files.
- `--force`: Ignore compatibility warnings for older file formats.
- `--mmap`: Use memory-mapped files for large files (>4 GB, requires sufficient memory).

### Examples
1. Encrypt all files in a folder:
   ```bash
   python crypt.argon2.py --encrypt --folder ./data --password mypass --verbose
   ```
   **Output**:
   ```
   cryptomator v2.6
   Processing encrypt in ./data (5 files), output: ./data/encrypted
   Encrypted ./data/file1.txt to ./data/encrypted/abc123... in 0.45s
   ...
   Completed encrypt in ./data: processed 5/5 files in 2.31s
   ```

2. Decrypt a single file:
   ```bash
   python crypt.argon2.py --decrypt --file ./encrypted/abc123 --password-file ./pass.txt
   ```
   **Output**:
   ```
   Decrypted ./encrypted/abc123 to ./decrypted/file1.txt in 0.38s
   ```

3. Analyze an encrypted fileâ€™s system block:
   ```bash
   python crypt.argon2.py --analyze --file ./encrypted/abc123 --debug
   ```
   **Output**:
   ```
   Analysis of ./encrypted/abc123:
   File size: 123456 bytes
   System block (780 bytes):
     Offset 0: Signature (8 bytes): 43525950547632
     Offset 8: Salt (64 bytes): 1a2b3c...
     Offset 72: Nonce (16 bytes): 4d5e6f...
     Offset 88: HMAC (64 bytes): 7a8b9c...
     ...
   Encrypted payload: 122676 bytes
   ```

4. Encrypt a large file with memory-mapped I/O:
   ```bash
   python crypt.argon2.py --encrypt --file ./large.bin --password mypass --mmap
   ```

## File Format
Encrypted files follow this structure:
```
[system_block (780 bytes)][encrypted_payload]
```
**System Block Details**:
- Signature: `CRYPTv2` (8 bytes).
- Salt: Random 64 bytes for Argon2id.
